decree doesn't say anything about daylight saving, but for now let's
# assume that it is daylight saving....
#
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-21):
# The Associated Press story on the time change, which can be found at
# http://www.lapalmainteractivo.com/guias/content/gen/ap/America_Latina/AMC_GEN_NICARAGUA_HORA.html
# and elsewhere, says (fifth paragraph, translated from Spanish):  "The last
# time that a change of clocks was applied to save energy was in the year 2000
# during the Arnoldo Aleman administration."...
# The northamerica file says that Nicaragua has been on UTC-6 continuously
# since December 1998.  I wasn't able to find any details of Nicaraguan time
# changes in 2000.  Perhaps a note could be added to the northamerica file, to
# the effect that we have indirect evidence that DST was observed in 2000.
#
# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2005-11-02):
# Nicaragua left DST the 2005-10-02 at 00:00 (local time).

# (my informal translation)
# By order of the president of the republic, Enrique Bolanos, Nicaragua
# advanced by sixty minutes their official time, yesterday at 2 in the
# morning, and will stay that way until 30.th. of september.

# My informal translation runs:
# The natural sun time is restored in all the national territory, in that the
# time is returned one hour at 01:00 am of October 1 of 2006.

# From Chris Dunn in
# <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=415007>
# (2007-03-15): In the Turks & Caicos Islands (America/Grand_Turk) the
# daylight saving dates for time changes have been adjusted to match
# the recent U.S. change of dates.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2007-04-28):
# http://www.turksandcaicos.tc/calendar/index.htm [2007-04-26]
# there is an entry for Nov 4 "Daylight Savings Time Ends 2007" and three
# rows before that there is an out of date entry for Oct:
# "Eastern Standard Times Begins 2007
# Clocks are set back one hour at 2:00 a.m. local Daylight Saving Time"
# indicating that the normal ET rules are followed.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-05-01):
# Shanks & Pottenger say they use US DST rules, but IATA SSIM (1991/1998)
# says they switch at midnight.  Go with Shanks & Pottenger.
